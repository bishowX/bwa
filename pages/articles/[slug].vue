const content = `<p>To maintain a competitive edge and increase efficiency, most companies will have no choice but to integrate AI technologies in the near future. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, says that AI will eventually be applied to \"every single process\" of JPMorgan's business, ranging from trading to hedging, database, research, and customer service. Dimon adds, \"It's idea generation.\" Dimon's view is shared by most CEOs, as in September 2023, U.S. human capital management company Workday, Inc. released a survey where 98% of CEOs said there was an \"immediate business benefit\" from implementing AI and machine learning.</p><img src=\"https://content-v2-stag.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/static/image/10bf66559dd45e1525b4e38919e4725b.jpg\" alt=\"4.jpg\"><p>The impact of AI on jobs will be dramatic, creating new challenges for workers. Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI warns, \"A lot of people working on AI pretend that it's only going to be good; it's only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced [...] jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.\" Many of the jobs affected are also likely to be white-collar jobs, unlike in previous waves of technology upending job markets, which primarily affected blue-collar jobs. According to a study released by researchers at Altman's OpenAI in March 2023, 80% of workers could see their jobs impacted by AI in some way, with writers, authors, reporters, journalists, financial analysts and mathematicians all being highly exposed.&nbsp;</p><p>For society, AI's quick growth through the job market will create even more societal risk and labor inequality. David Autor, an MIT labor economist who has published numerous papers on the impact of automation on jobs, says, \"The problem [and] challenge [with AI] and the one we faced so severely for the last four decades is income distribution. And if [AI] devalues many, many people's skills, then a lot of the benefits of that technology will go to the owners of the technology themselves itself rather than [...] the workers.\" A 2022 study authored in part by Autor's fellow economist at MIT, Daron Acemoglu, showed empirically that automation over the last four decades explained 50% to 70% of the growing income gap between more- and less-educated workers. AI is now expected to affect better-educated white-collar workers as the next wave of automation emerges;&nbsp; previous waves have already brought robots and heavy machinery onto the factory floor.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://content-v2-stag.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/static/image/e3a0b8726f223b883856e5bf3160ad82.jpg\" alt=\"25.jpg\"><p>Most empirical studies suggest that AI itself will not reduce the overall number of jobs as AI will create many new job types that did not exist before. However, the creation of new jobs and destruction of old jobs will not be uniform across society. In fact, this transformation is likely to have an outsized impact on certain industries and job types as workers may not have the skills that are now more in demand. Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University Professor of economics and former director of The Earth Institute, warns \"a lot of people are going to find that the jobs that they had been remunerated for in the past are not going to be the jobs in the future.\" The process of job destruction can wreak havoc on certain geographical regions that are heavily dependent on industries highly exposed to AI. Previous waves of automation helped hollow out U.S. manufacturing strongholds like Cleveland, Detroit, Gary and Pittsburgh, but concurrently, computerization of society led to flourishing job markets in Silicon Valley and other parts of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next three to five years, companies and governments that are the most successful at navigating the hurdles that AI presents for their workers and society on the whole will be those that are proactive in training their workers to use AI and develop the necessary skills to adapt to the changing work environment. Karim Lakhani, Dorothy &amp; Michael Hintze Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, argues that \"AI is not going to replace humans, but humans with AI are going to replace humans without AI.\" By initiating training programs that utilize AI and emphasizing in corporate messaging that AI is not going to entirely replace jobs, organizations can reduce workers' concerns about potential job losses due to AI, especially if these technologies can also help retrain people to allow them to move to other functions within the company.&nbsp;</p><p>AI will redefine dynamics between employers and employees and the unions representing them, likely leading to increased support for organized labor movements across the West despite the general weakening of labor unions in recent decades. 2023 may already be a harbinger of things to come where unions were extremely active – and largely successful – in high-profile labor action in the United States, including strikes or tense negotiations involving Hollywood writers and actors, teachers in Los Angeles, UPS workers and auto workers at Detroit's Big Three automakers. The impact of AI on those negotiations was clear. For example, in the case of the Hollywood strike, the use of AI to help write screenplays, scripts and scenes, as well as the use of AI to recreate actors and their voices, was a critical part of the grievances voiced by Hollywood's writers and actors.&nbsp;</p><p>AI will also increase pressure on companies to make significant changes to the workplace environment and working patterns. This change proved true in the starting negotiating position of the United Auto Workers union, which initially demanded a change to 32-hour work weeks. AI's increase in productivity is likely to increase calls to shift working schedules in the West to three- or four-day workweeks, as well as increase calls for flexible work locations. Jamie Dimon adds that in the future \"your children [will] probably be working 3.5 days a week,\" due to AI technology. While this shift is unlikely to occur soon across society, the adoption of AI may finally trigger more companies to move to a four-day work week, which many studies have shown will boost worker productivity and worker happiness, helping offset workers' fears about AI's impact on jobs.</p>`;
